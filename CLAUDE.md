Guidance for AI assistants (and humans) working in this repository.

## What this project is

**Voice Chunker** (repo: `cheer-splitter-9k`, deployed Worker: `cheer-splitter-9k`)
is a single-file, dependency-free web tool that:

1. Tags lines of dialogue by speaker (`NAME: text`),
2. Runs an ordered list of find/replace rules,
3. Splits the text into size-capped chunks — with an optional per-chunk prefix,
   an optional voice-switch cap, and speaker re-labeling when one line is cut
   across chunks.

It started life as a Twitch "cheer" copypasta formatter and was generalized into
a neutral text-chunking utility.

## The one file that matters

**[`public/index.html`](public/index.html) is the entire application.** It is a
self-contained HTML page with inline `<style>` and a single inline `<script>`
(vanilla JS, IIFE, `"use strict"`). **This is the only file to edit when changing
app behavior.** There is no `src/`, no bundler, no package manager.

Everything else in the repo is documentation or deploy config.

## Repository layout

| Path | Role |
|---|---|
| `public/` | **The deployed site.** Cloudflare serves *only* this directory, so docs stay out of production. |
| `public/index.html` | **The app.** Edit this. |
| `wrangler.jsonc` | Cloudflare Workers config — serves `public/` as static assets. |
| `package.json` | Dev-only metadata: `npm test` (Node's `node:test`) and the Wrangler dev/deploy scripts. No runtime deps. |
| `test/` | Node `node:test` suite — extracts the inline script from `public/index.html` and unit-tests the pure pipeline. |
| `.github/workflows/ci.yml` | CI: install, `npm test`, then `wrangler deploy --dry-run` on push/PR to `main`. |
| `.github/` | Community-health files (CONTRIBUTING, SECURITY, CODE_OF_CONDUCT, issue/PR templates, dependabot). |
| `docs/CHANGELOG.md` | Release notes / change history. |
| `README.md` | Human-facing overview, feature spec, deploy notes. |
| `CLAUDE.md` | This file — assistant-facing guidance. |
| `.gitignore` | Ignores wrangler/env artifacts (`.wrangler`, `.dev.vars*`, `.env*`) plus `node_modules/` and `package-lock.json`. |

## How to run / develop

There is **no build step**. Either:

- Open `public/index.html` directly in a browser, **or**
- Use the Cloudflare CLI from the repo root:

```sh
npx wrangler dev      # local preview of public/ as static assets
npx wrangler deploy   # publish to production (normally CI does this — see below)
```

To make a change: edit `public/index.html`, reload the browser. That's the whole
loop.

## Testing

```sh
npm test   # Node's built-in node:test runner — zero deps to install
```

The suite (in `test/`) reads `public/index.html`, extracts the single inline
`<script>` with a regex, and runs it in a `node:vm` context against a minimal
null-DOM (so the IIFE's load-time wiring doesn't throw). It then unit-tests the
**pure pipeline functions** (`splitSentences`, `parseSegments`, `expand`,
`pack`, `wrapText`, `countSwitches`, `matchSpeaker`, `applyReplacements`, …).

Those functions are reachable because of an **inert `module.exports` hook** at
the end of the IIFE: it is guarded by `typeof module !== "undefined"`, which is
false in browsers (so it ships nothing and the app stays one file) but true
under Node, where it hands the test harness the internal functions. CI runs the
same `npm test` (see `.github/workflows/ci.yml`).

## Deployment (Cloudflare Workers)

- Connected via **Workers Builds**. `public/` is served as
  [static assets](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/static-assets/);
  there is no Worker script, just assets.
- **Production** deploys on every push to **`main`** (runs `npx wrangler deploy`).
- **Pull requests** get an automatic preview deployment.
- Config is `wrangler.jsonc`: `name` = `cheer-splitter-9k`, `assets.directory` =
  `./public`.

Gotchas (from real debugging):
- Workers Builds **won't deploy production until `wrangler.jsonc` exists on
  `main`** — it does now.
- The **GitHub default branch** is independent of Cloudflare's **production
  branch**. Keep the GitHub default = `main` for consistency.

## Architecture of the app (script pipeline)

`run()` wires a straightforward pipeline (all functions inside the IIFE in
`public/index.html`):

1. `readOpts()` — gather settings from the form (prefix, separator, max chars,
   max switches, label format, toggles).
2. `applyReplacements(text, opts)` — apply each find→replace rule in order, using
   `escapeRe()` and regex flags driven by the **Match case** / **Whole word**
   toggles.
3. `parseSegments(text)` — split into lines; `NAME: text` becomes
   `{speaker, text}`, untagged lines become a `narrator` voice.
4. `expand(segments, opts)` — word-wrap any segment too long for one chunk
   (`wrapText()`), re-opening each continuation with the speaker label
   (`repeatSpeaker`) and `…` markers (`markCont`).
5. `pack(segments, opts)` — greedily pack segments into chunks that respect both
   `maxLen` (prefix counts toward the cap) and `maxSwitches`
   (`countSwitches()`, narrator excluded unless `countNarrator`).
6. `render(splits, opts)` — build the result cards (per-chunk char count, switch
   count, meter, copy button, plus copy-all).

Clipboard: `copyText()` uses `navigator.clipboard.writeText()` with an
`execCommand('copy')` fallback (`fb()`).

## Hard constraints — keep these true

These are the project's defining properties. **Do not break them without an
explicit request:**

- **One file.** No build step, no framework, no external resources. System font
  stacks only — **no web fonts, no CDN, no external images** (inline SVG icons
  are fine — they ship inside the file).
- **The shipped app stays zero-dependency.** "No dependencies" applies to what
  ships in `public/`: it must have **no runtime deps** and load nothing external.
  Dev-only tooling does **not** ship and does **not** violate this — Wrangler is
  a dev/deploy CLI (a `devDependency`), and the tests use only Node built-ins
  (`node:test`, `node:vm`, `node:fs`). Neither is bundled into `public/`. Do not
  add a runtime dependency, a `<script src>`, or any external fetch to the app,
  and do not split the single file to accommodate tooling.
- **No network calls.** `fetch`/XHR are not used and must not be added.
- **Storage:** the only `localStorage` use is remembering the light/dark theme
  choice (key `vc-theme`), wrapped in `try/catch` so sandboxed previews that
  block storage still render and run. Don't add other `localStorage` /
  `sessionStorage` use without an explicit request.
- **Vanilla JS**, IIFE-wrapped, `"use strict"`, ES5-ish style (`var`, function
  expressions) — match the surrounding code's idiom when editing.
- **Privacy:** everything runs client-side; pasted text never leaves the device.
  Preserve this.

## Feature spec (intended behavior)

- **Input mode:** a Script/Prose toggle (**Prose is the default**). **Script**
  parses `NAME: dialogue` lines (untagged → `narrator` voice); **Prose** ignores
  tags and splits a wall of text on sentence boundaries (it breaks only where end
  punctuation is followed by a space, so periods in URLs/decimals survive).
  Script's speaker match requires the colon to be followed by whitespace (or end
  of line) and the name to contain a letter, so URLs, clock times, and numeric
  lines aren't treated as speakers.
- **Replacements:** ordered find→replace rules; global Match-case and Whole-word
  toggles.
- **Chunking:** greedy pack into chunks ≤ "Max chars / chunk" (prefix counts
  toward the cap).
- **Prefix:** optional text prepended to every chunk.
- **Voice switches:** a switch = a speaker change between two adjacent lines in
  one chunk; cap is optional (blank = no limit). Narrator excluded unless "Count
  narrator as a voice" is on.
- **Continued lines (key behavior):** a line too long for one chunk is
  word-wrapped across chunks; each continuation re-opens with the speaker label
  (toggle) and is marked with `…` (toggle). Continuation chunks must reinforce
  who is speaking.
- **Output:** per-chunk char count, switch count, copy button, plus copy-all.
- **Theme:** an **Auto / Light / Dark** slider in the header. **Auto** (the
  default) follows the OS via `prefers-color-scheme`; Light/Dark pin an explicit
  choice. The selection persists (see Storage above).

## Conventions & gotchas for editors

- Keep style/markup/script **inline in the one file** — do not split into
  separate `.css`/`.js` assets.
- The app de-branded away from Twitch specifics; defaults are neutral (blank
  prefix, blank switch cap = no limit, `400`-char default, `ALICE`/`BOB`
  placeholders). Don't reintroduce use-case-specific defaults.

## Working in this repo (workflow for assistants)

- Branch: do development on the assigned feature branch; **never push directly to
  `main`** without explicit permission (a push to `main` triggers a production
  deploy).
- Pushing to a branch and opening a PR is the normal flow — PRs get Cloudflare
  preview deploys, which is how to verify changes safely.
- After pushing, ensure a PR exists for the branch.
